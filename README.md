# Jubilee-Austen

Hi everybody!

Meet Jubilee Austen, one of the projects I made during my learning @Skillcrush to become a developer.
The goal of this project was to set up, code, and launch my very own one-page website from a pre-made design comp. 
My job was to recreate the exact design using HTML and CSS.

Very kind regards!
Mariette
